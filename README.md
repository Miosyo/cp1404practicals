# Jesse's CP1404 Practicals

## Overview

Welcome to [Jesse's](http://www.github.com/jessepurcell) CP1404 Practicals repository, here I have
assembled the collection of practical exercises completed during the third trimester of 2023.

You can access the practical exercises at [CP1404 Practicals](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals).

My commitment is to maintain high standards of software development, with a focus on producing clean code that adheres
to the PEP8 style guide. I prioritize clear and meaningful naming conventions, as well as thoughtful design principles
in my work.

Additionally, you can find the programming patterns used throughout this repository documented
at [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns).

## Lessons Learned In This Subject About Clean Code

- The implementation of clean code fosters a more manageable codebase for enhanced maintainability.
- Clean code epitomizes code that is not only easily comprehensible but also a pleasure to read.
- The adoption of clean code practices mitigates the likelihood of errors and the need for substantial refactoring in
  the future.
