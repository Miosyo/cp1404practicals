# Practical 10

## Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
Regarding the estimates I felt very confident with judging the amount of work required, if a practical was going to be short or long. The larger the amount of work though the more my guess would be out.

## Regarding **code reviews**, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
I received minimal reviews back from other people but what I did receive definitely helped. I enjoyed reviewing others code for the most part as it gave insight into how other people would approach problems.

## Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
There's a lot I could say if I sat down and thought it through but the subject does give off the feeling that it's been carefully tweaked over time.
I felt like dictionaries weren't utilised too much and from the code reviews it did not seem like people had enough time to understand testing and classes.
This subject might also benefit from a group assignment to further help people understand how to collaborate with git as the seminar activities seemed to be a bit hit-and-miss when it came to this.
